          <p>
            Sheep are gentle, social animals raised all over the world for wool, meat and milk.
            They thrive when kept in groups and prefer open spaces with access to clean water,
            fresh air and proper food. This guide explains everything a beginner needs to know
            about sheep care—from daily routines and feeding to common health issues and treatment.
          </p>

          <p>
            Always remember: <strong>Sheep health begins with cleanliness, fresh fodder and preventive care.</strong>
          </p>

          <!-- 1. BEHAVIOUR -->
          <h2>1. Understanding sheep behaviour</h2>
          <p>
            Sheep are flock animals. They feel safe in groups and become stressed when isolated.
            A sudden change in movement, appetite or interaction often indicates a health issue.
          </p>

          <h3>Normal behaviour of healthy sheep</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Grazing calmly with the flock</li>
            <li>Chewing cud while resting</li>
            <li>Bright eyes and alert head movements</li>
            <li>Steady walking without limping</li>
            <li>Clean nose and normal breathing</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Warning signs of illness</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Isolating from the flock</li>
            <li>Drooping head or ears</li>
            <li>Poor appetite or refusal to graze</li>
            <li>Nasal discharge, coughing or rapid breathing</li>
            <li>Scouring (diarrhoea) or extremely hard pellets</li>
          </ul>

          <!-- 2. HOUSING -->
          <h2>2. Housing and environment</h2>
          <p>
            Good housing protects sheep from rain, extreme cold, predators and diseases.
            A simple, well-ventilated shed is usually enough, as long as it remains dry.
          </p>

          <h3>Housing requirements for sheep</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Dry flooring:</strong> Moisture leads to foot rot and pneumonia.</li>
            <li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Sheep need fresh air but no direct drafts.</li>
            <li><strong>Space:</strong> Provide at least 12–16 sq. ft per adult sheep.</li>
            <li><strong>Bedding:</strong> Straw, sand or wood shavings keep the animals warm.</li>
            <li><strong>Predator safety:</strong> Use fencing to keep out dogs, foxes or wolves.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Clean the shed daily. Wet dung, urine and old bedding attract flies and parasites.
          </p>

          <!-- 3. FEEDING -->
          <h2>3. Feeding and watering sheep</h2>
          <p>
            Sheep mainly eat grass, hay and leaves. A balanced diet improves wool quality,
            strengthens immunity and supports healthy lamb growth.
          </p>

          <h3>Main feed sources for sheep</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Fresh grass and pasture</li>
            <li>Legume fodder (lucerne, clover)</li>
            <li>Hay for fibre</li>
            <li>Concentrates for pregnant or lactating ewes</li>
            <li>Mineral mixture and salt lick</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Feeding guidelines</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Introduce new feed slowly to prevent bloat.</li>
            <li>Never give mouldy fodder.</li>
            <li>Give extra nutrition to pregnant and milking ewes.</li>
            <li>Provide long fibre daily to support digestion.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Water needs</h3>
          <p>
            Sheep may drink 2–6 litres of water daily depending on weather and feed.
            Clean water is essential to avoid dehydration and kidney issues.
          </p>

          <!-- 4. DISEASES -->
          <h2>4. Common diseases in sheep</h2>

          <h3>Pneumonia</h3>
          <p>
            Very common in lambs. Caused by cold, wet bedding, overcrowding or sudden weather change.
          </p>

          <h3>Foot rot</h3>
          <p>
            A painful hoof infection caused by bacteria and wet ground.
            Regular hoof trimming and dry floors prevent it.
          </p>

          <h3>Internal parasites (worms)</h3>
          <p>
            Worm infestation leads to weak growth, anaemia and diarrhoea.
            Deworm regularly as per your veterinarian’s advice.
          </p>

          <h3>External parasites</h3>
          <p>
            Lice and mites cause itching, wool loss and skin infection.
          </p>

          <h3>Scours (diarrhoea)</h3>
          <p>
            Often seen in lambs due to worms, dirty milk bottles or infections.
          </p>

          <!-- 5. PREVENTION -->
          <h2>5. Prevention and basic treatment</h2>

          <h3>Daily care checklist</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Observe how sheep walk and eat</li>
            <li>Check manure for diarrhoea</li>
            <li>Look for nasal discharge or coughing</li>
            <li>Examine hooves for cracks or swelling</li>
            <li>Replace wet bedding immediately</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Vet should be called immediately if</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A sheep cannot stand or walks with pain</li>
            <li>There is continuous diarrhoea</li>
            <li>A lamb refuses to suckle</li>
            <li>Severe breathing difficulty</li>
            <li>High fever or sudden behaviour change</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Avoid giving human medicines without proper guidance. Wrong dosage can be dangerous for sheep.
          </p>

          <!-- 6. HANDLING -->
          <h2>6. Gentle handling and shepherd safety</h2>
          <p>
            Sheep are easily stressed. Calm and slow movements keep the flock cooperative.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Avoid shouting or chasing.</li>
            <li>Use guiding boards or narrow passages to move sheep.</li>
            <li>Hold lambs gently around the body—never by legs.</li>
            <li>Trim hooves regularly to avoid lameness.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>7. Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Good sheep care is all about clean housing, balanced feeding, regular deworming and
            early detection of illness. When managed properly, sheep stay healthy, reproduce well
            and provide high-quality wool and meat. Small steps in daily care make a huge difference
            in flock health and productivity.
