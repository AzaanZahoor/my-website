          <p>
            Goats are one of the most popular farm animals because they are intelligent, friendly,
            easy to raise and require less space compared to cows or buffaloes. With proper care,
            goats can provide milk, meat, fibre and even natural weed control.
            This guide explains the basics of goat care in simple English so that beginners,
            small farmers and new caretakers can easily understand each step.
          </p>

          <p>
            Remember: <strong>Healthy goats grow fast, breed well and resist disease better.</strong>
            Most health problems can be avoided through good feeding, clean housing and regular observation.
          </p>

          <!-- 1. BEHAVIOUR -->
          <h2>1. Understanding goat behaviour</h2>
          <p>
            Goats are naturally curious and active animals. They love exploring, climbing and interacting
            with their group. Behaviour is the first sign of health — a sick goat usually becomes quiet,
            isolated and unwilling to eat.
          </p>

          <h3>Signs of a healthy goat</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bright, alert eyes and upright ears</li>
            <li>Active movements, tail flicking and curiosity</li>
            <li>Good appetite and normal chewing</li>
            <li>Smooth coat and steady breathing</li>
            <li>Stays with the herd instead of isolating</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Warning signs of illness or discomfort</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Not eating or drinking properly</li>
            <li>Drooping ears, dull eyes, weak standing posture</li>
            <li>Loose motion, very hard droppings or unusual smell</li>
            <li>Coughing, nasal discharge or fast breathing</li>
            <li>Sitting in corners or avoiding the herd</li>
          </ul>

          <!-- 2. HOUSING -->
          <h2>2. Housing and shelter for goats</h2>
          <p>
            Goats can tolerate a wide range of weather conditions, but they must be protected from rain,
            cold winds and wet floors. Moisture and dirt are the biggest enemies of goat health.
          </p>

          <h3>Housing essentials</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Dry floor:</strong> Use raised platforms or wooden slats to keep goats off wet ground.</li>
            <li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Allow fresh air to prevent pneumonia.</li>
            <li><strong>Space:</strong> Provide enough room for goats to move freely (at least 10–15 sq. ft per goat).</li>
            <li><strong>Bedding:</strong> Use dry straw, sand or wood shavings and replace regularly.</li>
            <li><strong>Fencing:</strong> Goats can jump — so use strong fencing to keep them safe.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Cleanliness is extremely important. Dirty sheds cause worms, skin diseases, pneumonia and rapid spread
            of infection in young goats.
          </p>

          <!-- 3. FEEDING -->
          <h2>3. Feeding and watering goats</h2>
          <p>
            Goats are natural browsers—they prefer leaves, bushes and shrubs more than grass.
            A balanced diet ensures strong immunity, better milk production and healthy growth.
          </p>

          <h3>Main feed items for goats</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Fresh green fodder (legumes, leaves, shrubs)</li>
            <li>Dry fodder (hay, straw) for daily fibre</li>
            <li>Cereal grains in limited amounts</li>
            <li>Mineral mixture and salt block</li>
            <li>Clean drinking water available all the time</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Feeding guidelines</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Give small meals multiple times a day.</li>
            <li>Avoid sudden feed changes to prevent bloating.</li>
            <li>Do not give mouldy, wet or fungus-infected fodder.</li>
            <li>Provide mineral mixture 3–4 times per week.</li>
            <li>Pregnant and lactating goats need extra nutrients.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Water needs</h3>
          <p>
            Goats drink 2–5 litres of water daily, depending on climate and milk production.
            Always ensure access to clean, fresh water.
          </p>

          <!-- 4. DISEASES -->
          <h2>4. Common diseases in goats</h2>

          <h3>Pneumonia</h3>
          <p>
            One of the most common causes of death in young goats. Caused by cold winds,
            sudden weather change or wet bedding.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fast breathing, coughing, nasal discharge</li>
            <li>Keep the goat warm and call a vet immediately</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Diarrhoea (Scours)</h3>
          <p>
            Often caused by worms, sudden feed change, dirty water or infections.
          </p>

          <h3>Bloat</h3>
          <p>
            Stomach swelling due to overeating or sudden diet change — can be dangerous.
          </p>

          <h3>Foot rot</h3>
          <p>
            Wet or dirty floors cause hoof infection and lameness.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clean hooves regularly</li>
            <li>Keep floor dry</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>External parasites</h3>
          <p>
            Ticks, lice and mites cause itching, hair loss and weight loss.
          </p>

          <!-- 5. PREVENTION -->
          <h2>5. Prevention and basic treatment</h2>

          <h3>Daily care checklist</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Observe eating and drinking behaviour</li>
            <li>Check droppings for hardness or diarrhoea</li>
            <li>Inspect eyes, nose and ears for discharge</li>
            <li>Look for limping or swollen joints</li>
            <li>Keep shed dry and clean</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>When to call a vet urgently</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Sudden weakness or inability to stand</li>
            <li>Continuous coughing or fever</li>
            <li>Severe diarrhoea or blood in stool</li>
            <li>Bloat not reducing within 1 hour</li>
            <li>Goat refusing to eat for more than one meal</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Never give human medicines or antibiotics without proper veterinary guidance.
            Wrong dosage can harm the goat’s liver, kidneys and rumen bacteria.
          </p>

          <!-- 6. HANDLING -->
          <h2>6. Safe and gentle handling</h2>
          <p>
            Goats are sensitive but friendly animals. Rough handling makes them fearful and difficult to manage.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Use calm voice and slow movements</li>
            <li>Do not pull ears or legs</li>
            <li>Train goats to follow simple commands</li>
            <li>Secure them gently during hoof trimming or examination</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>7. Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Raising goats successfully requires clean housing, balanced feeding, daily observation
            and gentle handling. With proper care, goats stay healthy, reproduce well and provide
            good-quality milk and meat. Small improvements in hygiene and management can prevent
            most diseases and keep your herd strong and productive.
