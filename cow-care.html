          <p>
            Cows are gentle, social and intelligent farm animals. Taking care of them is a daily responsibility
            that directly affects milk quality, fertility, behaviour and overall health.
            Whether you manage a single cow or a full herd, the basic rules of care remain the same:
            clean housing, balanced feeding, regular health checks and calm handling.
          </p>

          <p>
            Remember: <strong>Healthy cows give healthy milk.</strong>
            Good management prevents most diseases and reduces veterinary costs.
          </p>

          <!-- 1. BEHAVIOUR -->
          <h2>1. Understanding basic cow behaviour</h2>
          <p>
            A cow’s behaviour is one of the earliest indicators of health. Cows follow routines—they like to eat,
            rest and ruminate at predictable times. Any sudden change in behaviour should be taken seriously.
          </p>

          <h3>Signs of a relaxed cow</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Regular chewing (rumination) while sitting or standing</li>
            <li>Calm, steady walking without limping</li>
            <li>Bright eyes and moist nose</li>
            <li>Normal interest in feed and water</li>
            <li>Resting comfortably on one side</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Warning signs of stress or discomfort</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Refusal to eat or drink</li>
            <li>Lameness or difficulty standing</li>
            <li>Separation from herd and unusual isolation</li>
            <li>Rapid breathing or excessive drooling</li>
            <li>Constant mooing, tail flicking or kicking the sides</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Early detection helps prevent bigger issues like mastitis, fever, foot rot or digestive disorders.
          </p>

          <!-- 2. HOUSING -->
          <h2>2. Housing and environment</h2>
          <p>
            Good housing ensures comfort, safety and hygiene. A cow should always have a clean, dry and comfortable
            resting place with enough space to move freely.
          </p>

          <h3>Important housing requirements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Ensure fresh air flow to reduce heat stress and ammonia smell.</li>
            <li><strong>Flooring:</strong> Clean, non-slippery and slightly soft flooring prevents injuries.</li>
            <li><strong>Bedding:</strong> Dry straw or sand bedding keeps cows comfortable and reduces mastitis.</li>
            <li><strong>Space:</strong> Provide enough room to lie down, stand up and turn without slipping.</li>
            <li><strong>Cleanliness:</strong> Remove dung at least twice daily to prevent flies and diseases.</li>
          </ul>

          <!-- 3. FEEDING -->
          <h2>3. Feeding and watering cows</h2>
          <p>
            A cow’s diet affects milk yield, digestion, fertility and immunity. Feeding must be consistent,
            clean and appropriate for the cow’s age and purpose (dairy, pregnant, dry cow, calf mother etc.).
          </p>

          <h3>General feeding rules</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide green fodder (grass, legumes) daily.</li>
            <li>Give dry fodder like hay for extra fibre.</li>
            <li>Use clean, fresh feed—no mould or fungus.</li>
            <li>Do not change feed suddenly; introduce new feed gradually.</li>
            <li>Provide access to a mineral mixture or salt lick.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Concentrates and supplements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Dairy cows need concentrate feed for milk production.</li>
            <li>Pregnant cows require extra minerals for healthy calves.</li>
            <li>Always follow the advice of a veterinarian or nutritionist.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Water needs</h3>
          <p>
            A cow drinks 40–80 litres of water per day depending on weather and milk production.
            Water must always be fresh and easily available.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide clean water 24/7.</li>
            <li>Wash troughs daily to prevent algae and worms.</li>
            <li>During summer, provide water more frequently.</li>
          </ul>

          <!-- 4. DISEASES -->
          <h2>4. Common diseases and health problems</h2>

          <h3>Mastitis</h3>
          <p>
            Mastitis is an udder infection caused by bacteria. It results in swollen udders, fever and reduced milk quality.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Check for clots or blood in milk.</li>
            <li>Keep udders clean before and after milking.</li>
            <li>Use proper milking hygiene to prevent infection.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Foot and hoof problems</h3>
          <p>
            Cracks, foot rot and lameness are common in cows kept on wet or dirty floors.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Trim hooves regularly.</li>
            <li>Keep flooring dry and clean.</li>
            <li>Check for wounds, swelling or foul smell.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Digestive disorders</h3>
          <p>
            Bloat, acidosis, indigestion and diarrhoea can occur due to poor-quality or sudden feed changes.
          </p>

          <h3>Parasites</h3>
          <p>
            Internal and external parasites cause weight loss, dull coat and reduced milk.
            Deworming and clean housing help prevent this.
          </p>

          <!-- 5. PREVENTION -->
          <h2>5. Prevention and basic treatment steps</h2>
          <p>
            Most health issues are preventable through daily monitoring and early action.
          </p>

          <h3>Daily health checklist</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Observe appetite and water intake.</li>
            <li>Check dung consistency.</li>
            <li>Examine udders for heat or swelling.</li>
            <li>Watch for limping or abnormal posture.</li>
            <li>Keep a record of milk yield, changes and medicines.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>When to call the vet immediately</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Sudden drop in milk production.</li>
            <li>High fever or rapid breathing.</li>
            <li>Swollen udder or blood in milk.</li>
            <li>Severe lameness or inability to stand.</li>
            <li>No eating or drinking for more than one meal.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Never give human medicines or antibiotics without veterinary consultation.
            Incorrect dosage can harm the cow or spoil milk for human consumption.
          </p>

          <!-- 6. HANDLING -->
          <h2>6. Gentle handling and caretaker safety</h2>
          <p>
            Cows respond well to calm handling. Rough treatment increases stress and reduces milk production.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Approach cows slowly and speak softly.</li>
            <li>Do not shout or hit the animal.</li>
            <li>Keep the milking area clean and slip-free.</li>
            <li>Use proper restraints only when necessary.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>7. Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Cow care is a daily commitment. With balanced feeding, clean housing, gentle handling and regular health
            checks, any caretaker can maintain high-quality milk production and ensure a long, healthy life for the cow.
