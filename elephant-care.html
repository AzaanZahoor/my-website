          <p>
            Elephants are intelligent, emotional and extremely strong animals. Caring for them is a big responsibility.
            A single mistake in housing, feeding or handling can lead to long-term health problems or dangerous behaviour.
            This guide explains elephant care in clear, practical steps so that even a new caretaker can understand the
            basic needs of the animal.
          </p>

          <p>
            Always remember one key principle: <strong>prevention is easier and kinder than treatment</strong>.
            If you provide clean water, suitable food, enough space, gentle handling and regular health checks,
            many serious diseases and accidents can be avoided.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Understanding basic elephant behaviour</h2>
          <p>
            Before talking about feed and disease, it is important to understand how elephants think and behave.
            Elephants live in social groups in the wild. They communicate through sound, touch and body posture.
            A stressed or lonely elephant will often show behavioural changes long before a physical illness appears.
          </p>

          <h3>Common signs of a relaxed elephant</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Slow, rhythmic ear flapping and relaxed trunk movements.</li>
            <li>Normal interest in food and water, regular chewing and drinking.</li>
            <li>Eyes appear soft, half-closed at times, with no constant staring.</li>
            <li>Body weight is evenly balanced on all four feet.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Warning signs of stress or discomfort</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Restless pacing, swinging the head or trunk in a repeated pattern.</li>
            <li>Refusing food, or suddenly eating much less than normal.</li>
            <li>Trying to lean on objects or lifting a leg repeatedly (possible foot pain).</li>
            <li>Loud trumpeting, sudden aggression or trying to break chains or fences.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            When you notice early stress signs, do not punish the elephant. Instead, check housing, chains, feet,
            weather conditions and recent work schedule. Correcting the cause quickly can save the animal and handlers
            from serious harm.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Housing and environment</h2>
          <p>
            Elephants need space, shade and a safe floor. Hard, slippery floors and tight chains are a common reason
            for foot problems, joint disease and behavioural issues.
          </p>

          <h3>Key housing points</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Space:</strong> The elephant should be able to lie down, turn around and walk a few steps
              even when tied. Avoid narrow, dark corners.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Floor:</strong> Prefer compacted soil with rubber mats or a layer of sand. Avoid long-term
              standing on concrete, especially if the surface is uneven or broken.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Shade &amp; weather protection:</strong> Provide natural shade from trees or a strong roof
              to protect from heat and heavy rain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cleanliness:</strong> Remove dung and wet bedding daily to prevent flies, worms and foot rot.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Feeding and watering elephants</h2>
          <p>
            A healthy adult elephant eats a large amount of roughage every day – mainly grass, leaves, branches and
            agricultural by-products. Sudden changes in diet, dirty feed or low-quality water quickly result in digestive
            problems.
          </p>

          <h3>General feeding rules</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide fresh, clean fodder several times a day instead of one very large meal.</li>
            <li>Allow slow eating time. Elephants should not be rushed while chewing.</li>
            <li>Offer a variety of grasses and tree branches to improve fibre and mineral intake.</li>
            <li>Avoid rotten, mouldy or chemically sprayed plants.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Concentrates and supplements</h3>
          <p>
            In some management systems, elephants are also given concentrates such as grains or specially prepared
            pellets. These should be introduced slowly and must never replace roughage completely.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Introduce new concentrate feed over 7–10 days to prevent colic.</li>
            <li>Use mineral and salt blocks to meet trace element needs.</li>
            <li>Consult a veterinarian or experienced nutritionist before big feed changes.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Water needs</h3>
          <p>
            Elephants drink a lot of water every day, especially in hot climates. Water must be clean and easily
            available.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide access to fresh water several times per day.</li>
            <li>If possible, allow bathing in a pond or with a hose to cool the body and clean the skin.</li>
            <li>Clean water troughs regularly to prevent algae, mosquito breeding and contamination.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. Common diseases and health problems</h2>
          <p>
            Elephants can suffer from many of the same problems as other large animals – digestive diseases, respiratory
            infections, skin conditions, parasites and injuries. Here we mention a few common issues seen in captive
            elephants.
          </p>

          <h3>Foot problems</h3>
          <p>
            Foot disease is one of the most serious long-term problems for elephants kept on hard or dirty floors.
            Cracks, overgrown nails and deep infections can become extremely painful and may even make the animal
            dangerous to handle.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Check the feet daily for cracks, abnormal smell or bleeding.</li>
            <li>Keep floors dry and remove sharp stones or metal pieces.</li>
            <li>Regularly trim the nails and sole, ideally with the help of an experienced professional.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Digestive disorders</h3>
          <p>
            Sudden change of feed, spoiled fodder or low water intake can lead to colic, constipation or diarrhoea.
            Signs include loss of appetite, unusual faeces, restlessness and abdominal discomfort.
          </p>

          <h3>Parasites and skin problems</h3>
          <p>
            Internal worms and external parasites like ticks and mites may cause weight loss, poor coat condition and
            itching. Periodic deworming, clean housing and regular bathing help to prevent these problems.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Prevention and basic treatment steps</h2>
          <p>
            Any sick elephant must be checked by a qualified veterinarian as early as possible. However, caretakers
            play an important role in prevention and first response.
          </p>

          <h3>Daily health routine</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Observe appetite, water intake and dung consistency every day.</li>
            <li>Check eyes, ears, mouth and skin for discharge, wounds or swelling.</li>
            <li>Inspect feet carefully and report any change immediately.</li>
            <li>Keep a written record of work load, feed, medicine and illness signs.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>When to call the vet urgently</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Elephant stops eating or drinking for more than one meal.</li>
            <li>Severe lameness, swelling of feet or legs, or inability to stand.</li>
            <li>Continuous diarrhoea, blood in dung or very hard, dry faeces.</li>
            <li>High temperature, difficulty breathing or nasal discharge.</li>
            <li>Sudden behaviour change – extreme aggression, depression or collapse.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Never give strong human medicines or antibiotics without veterinary supervision. Wrong dosage or wrong
            drug can damage the kidneys, liver and stomach and may make future treatment harder.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Gentle handling and safety for caretakers</h2>
          <p>
            Safe elephant care protects both the animal and the people working around it. Use voice commands,
            rewards and calm body language. Avoid beating, shouting or using painful tools, because this increases
            fear and aggression.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Establish a fixed team of handlers so the elephant recognises familiar people.</li>
            <li>Use clear, consistent commands and reward cooperative behaviour.</li>
            <li>Keep emergency exits clear in the working area.</li>
            <li>Do not allow untrained visitors to stand too close to the elephant.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>7. Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Good elephant care is not only about feeding a large quantity of food. It is about observing behaviour,
            maintaining clean and comfortable housing, planning a stable diet and responding early when something
            looks wrong. By following the principles in this guide – and working closely with a qualified veterinarian –
            you can greatly improve the health, lifespan and quality of life of the elephant under your responsibility.
